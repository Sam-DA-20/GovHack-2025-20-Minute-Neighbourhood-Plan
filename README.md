# GovHack 2025 â€“ Delivering the 20-Minute Neighbourhood

<!-- ## ðŸš€ Project Overview
The "20-Minute Neighbourhood" is a Victorian Government initiative that aims to ensure people can access most of their daily needs (schools, shops, parks, health services) within a 20-minute walk, cycle, or public transport trip from home.

My GovHack 2025 project focuses on "school accessibility" â€“ a key daily activity for Victorian households. Using real travel survey data and school locations, we explored:
- How long students take to travel to school
- Whether trips meet the 20-minute neighbourhood goal
- How students travel (mode share)
- Which LGAs have the best and worst accessibility
- The geographic distribution of schools across Victoria

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

### 1. Trips within 20 minutes
- "70% of school trips are completed within 20 minutes" (478 out of 684 journeys).
- âœ… A majority meet the 20-minute neighbourhood objective, but 30% still do not.

### 2. Mode of travel
- Travel to school is still "heavily car-dependent".
- Walking and public transport are used but remain secondary modes.

### 3. Average travel time by LGA
- Some LGAs have "significantly higher average school travel times".
- We identified "Top 5 Best" and "Top 5 Worst" LGAs for accessibility.

### 4. School locations across Victoria
- Schools are broadly distributed across the state.
- The interactive map shows **coverage by school type** (Primary, Secondary, Specialist, Combined). -->
